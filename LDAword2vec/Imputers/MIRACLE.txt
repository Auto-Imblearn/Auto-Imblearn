The MIRACLE imputation method, short for Missing data Imputation Refinement And Causal LEarning, is designed to handle missing data while preserving the causal structure of the dataset. MIRACLE refines existing baseline imputation methods iteratively. It works by learning a missingness graph (m-graph) that captures causal relationships between variables and their missingness indicators. This graph regularizes the imputation function, ensuring it aligns with the causal structure of the data. MIRACLE uses a combination of reconstruction loss, causal regularization, and moment regularization to achieve accurate imputations. The reconstruction loss ensures that the imputed values match the observed data, the causal regularizer enforces that the imputation function respects the causal graph, and the moment regularizer leverages constraints in the missingness pattern to enhance imputation accuracy.

One advantage of MIRACLE is its ability to improve imputation quality consistently across different missing data scenarios, including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). MIRACLE's robustness comes from refining imputations through learning from the causal structure, reducing the risk of introducing spurious correlations that are common in traditional imputation methods.

However, MIRACLE also has some disadvantages. Its performance can be negatively impacted if the underlying assumptions about the causal structure are violated. For instance, if the missingness indicators can cause the endogenous variables, the assumptions do not hold, leading to potential performance degradation. Additionally, MIRACLE relies on accurate causal discovery, which is still a challenging research area, especially under conditions of missing data. The method may also struggle with very high-dimensional data due to its computational complexity.

The datasets used to evaluate MIRACLE include synthetic data and a variety of real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These datasets cover diverse domains such as Autism, Life expectancy, Energy, Abalone, Protein Structure, Communities and Crime, Yeast, Mammographic Masses, Wine Quality, and Facebook Metrics. In experiments, MIRACLE consistently improved imputation performance across these diverse datasets, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in handling different types of missing data scenarios.
